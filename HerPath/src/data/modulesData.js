Think of financial health like physical health - it's not about being perfect, but about having the knowledge, habits, and systems in place to maintain stability and grow stronger over time.

Key indicators of good financial health include:
• Living within your means
• Having emergency savings
• Managing debt responsibly
• Planning for the future
• Feeling confident about money decisions

Remember: Financial health is a journey, not a destination. Everyone starts somewhere, and small steps lead to big changes!`,

            text: `Just like physical and mental health, financial health is one important dimension of your overall well-being. Understanding how these dimensions connect helps you see the bigger picture.

The main dimensions of health include:
• Physical Health - Your body's well-being
• Mental Health - Your emotional and psychological well-being
• Social Health - Your relationships and community connections
• Financial Health - Your economic well-being and security

These dimensions are interconnected. Financial stress can impact your mental health, while good financial planning can reduce anxiety and improve your overall quality of life. When you feel financially secure, you have more energy and resources to invest in other areas of your life.

Building financial health gives you:
• Peace of mind and reduced stress
• Freedom to pursue your goals
• Ability to help others when needed
• Confidence in your future`,

Key financial skills you'll develop:

• Understanding credit and debt
• Planning for short and long-term goals

This approach empowers you to:
• Apply knowledge in real-life situations
• Adapt to changing circumstances
• Make confident financial decisions
• Build habits that last a lifetime

Throughout these modules, you'll practice these skills through action items and real-world scenarios. Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can!`,

• Can be used at ATMs to withdraw cash
• No interest charges (unlike credit cards)

Debit vs. Credit:
• Debit: Uses your own money immediately

• Mortgages
• Personal loans

Credit is important because:
• It allows you to make large purchases over time
• It's often necessary for major life milestones (college, car, home)
• It demonstrates financial responsibility to lenders
• Good credit can save you money through lower interest rates
• Many employers and landlords check credit history`,

Debt Snowball Method:
• Pay minimums on all debts
• Put extra money toward smallest debt
• Once paid off, roll that payment to next smallest
• Builds momentum with quick wins

Debt Avalanche Method:
• Pay minimums on all debts
• Put extra money toward highest interest rate debt
• Saves more money on interest
• Mathematically optimal

Which to choose:
• Snowball: Better for motivation, quick wins
• Avalanche: Better for saving money on interest
• Choose what keeps you motivated!

Key principles:
• Always pay minimums on all debts
• Don't take on new debt while paying off old
• Consider balance transfers (if beneficial)
• Stay disciplined and consistent`,

❌ Payday loans
   • Extremely high interest (often 400%+ APR)
   • Can trap you in cycle of debt
   • Avoid at all costs

❌ Credit card minimum payments only
   • Takes decades to pay off
   • Pay huge amounts in interest
   • Always pay more than minimum

❌ Using credit for wants, not needs
   • Credit cards aren't free money
   • Only use for what you can afford
   • Pay in full each month if possible

❌ Ignoring debt
   • Doesn't make it go away
   • Hurts credit score
   • Can lead to collections

❌ Borrowing to pay off debt
   • Usually makes situation worse
   • Only consider if significantly lower interest

Remember: The best debt is no debt. But if you have it, face it head-on with a plan!`,

Investing vs. Saving:
• Saving: Low risk, low return, easily accessible
• Investing: Higher risk, higher potential return, longer-term

Why invest:
• Beat inflation (prices go up over time)
• Build wealth faster than saving alone
• Reach long-term goals (retirement, major purchases)
• Make money work for you

Key principle: Time is your best friend
• Start early = more time for growth
• Compound returns = returns on your returns
• Small amounts grow significantly over decades

Common investments:
• Stocks: Ownership in companies
• Bonds: Loans to companies/governments
• Mutual funds: Baskets of stocks/bonds
• ETFs: Exchange-traded funds (like mutual funds)
• Real estate: Property ownership`,

  - Higher chance of losses

Diversification reduces risk:
• Don't put all eggs in one basket
• Spread investments across different types
• Reduces impact of any single investment failing

• Time horizon (how long until you need money)
• Financial situation
• Comfort level with volatility
